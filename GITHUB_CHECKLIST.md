# 📋 GitHub Publication Checklist

Your Tree of Thought benchmarking project is ready for GitHub! Here's your step-by-step guide:

## 🚀 Publishing Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. **Repository name**: `tree-of-thought-benchmarking` (or your preferred name)
4. **Description**: "Benchmarking suite comparing Tree of Thought vs standard prompting with Phi4-mini-reasoning"
5. ✅ **Public** (your first public repo!)
6. ❌ Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code
GitHub will show you commands, but here's what to run in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/bsoldate/Projects/ToT_Tuning
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tree-of-thought-benchmarking.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enhance Your Repository
After publishing, consider these optional improvements:

#### Add Topics/Tags
In your GitHub repo settings, add topics:
- `tree-of-thought`
- `llm-benchmarking`
- `phi4`
- `ollama`
- `reasoning`
- `python`

#### Enable Discussions
